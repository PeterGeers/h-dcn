6. **Set up your passkey** when prompted:
   - Use your fingerprint (Touch ID/Windows Hello)
   - Use face recognition (Face ID)
   - Use a security key (YubiKey, etc.)
   - Or use your device's PIN/pattern

### Future Logins

Once you've set up your passkey, logging in is super easy:

## 📧 Your Email Address

Your login email is the same email address you used in the old system. If you're not sure what email address is registered, contact the H-DCN administrators.

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

**Can't find the verification email?**

- Check your spam/junk folder
- Make sure you're using the correct email address
- Contact H-DCN support if needed

**Passkey setup not working?**
