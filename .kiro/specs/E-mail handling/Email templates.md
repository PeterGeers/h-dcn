Email templates
🚀 Implementation Plan
Phase 1: S3 Template Storage
Create S3 bucket for templates
Upload current templates as HTML files
Create variables.json config file
Update Lambda to read from S3
Phase 2: Frontend Editor
Add "Email Templates" section to admin panel
Template list with edit buttons
Rich text editor with variable insertion
Live preview with variable substitution
Save directly to S3
Phase 3: Advanced Features
Template versioning and rollback
A/B testing different templates
Multi-language template support
Email analytics and open rates
💡 Quick Implementation
Want me to create this system? I can:

Create the S3 bucket structure
Convert current Lambda templates to S3 files
Update Lambda to read from S3
Create a basic frontend template editor
This would give you:

Immediate template editing without deployments
Admin-friendly interface for non-technical users
Better template management with versioning
Should we implement this S3 + Frontend template system? It's a much more professional and maintainable approach than hardcoded Lambda templates!
